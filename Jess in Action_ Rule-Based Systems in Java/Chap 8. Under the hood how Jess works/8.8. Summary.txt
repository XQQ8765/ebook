8.8. Summary

Jess uses the fast, efficient Rete algorithm for pattern matching. The strength of Rete is that it uses a set of memories to retain information about the success or failure of pattern matches during previous cycles.

The Rete algorithm involves building a network of pattern-matching nodes. Jess uses many different kinds of nodes to represent the many different kinds of pattern-matching activities. There are also special nodes to handle some conditional elements like not and test, as well as special behavior in some nodes to handle backward chaining.

This chapter concludes the introduction to Jess. In the next part of this book, and in each subsequent part, you will develop a nontrivial application. Each application is standalone, but each part of the book builds on the knowledge and skills developed during the previous parts.
