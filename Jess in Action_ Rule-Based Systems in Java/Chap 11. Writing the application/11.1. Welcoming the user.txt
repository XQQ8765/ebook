11.1. Welcoming the user

The startup module for this application is very simple. It doesn¡¯t really have any work to do, other than serving as a launching point. You want to print a welcome banner when the user first sees the application, so you can define a rule in startup to display one:

(defmodule startup)

(defrule print-banner
    =>
    (printout t "Type your name and press Enter> ")
    (bind ?name (read))
    (printout t crlf "*****************************" crlf)
    (printout t "Hello, " ?name "." crlf)
    (printout t "Welcome to the tax forms advisor" crlf)
    (printout t "Please answer the questions and" crlf)
    (printout t "I will tell you what tax forms" crlf)
    (printout t "you may need to file." crlf)
    (printout t "*****************************" crlf crlf))

11.1.1. Testing the startup module

Whenever you write a rule or cooperating group of rules, you should make sure they work. To test the simple rule print-banner, you can just reset working memory, set the focus, and run (text in bold indicates characters you type in response to a prompt):

Jess> (reset)
TRUE
Jess> (focus startup)
MAIN
Jess> (run)
Type your name and press Enter> Fred
**********************************
 Hello, Fred.
 Welcome to the tax forms advisor
 Please answer the questions and
 I will tell you what tax forms
 you may need to file.
