11.5. Finishing touches

Now that all the rules are written, you need a way to start your program. Because the module focus must be shifted several times during each run of the application, it is helpful to define a deffunction to perform the proper sequence of operations:

(deffunction run-system ()
    (reset)
    (focus startup interview recommend report)
    (run))

The single call to focus sets up the focus stack so the four modules become active in the right order. The program can then be executed with a single call to run-system. This application is intended to run continuously in a kiosk at the post office, so you call this function in a loop:

(while TRUE
    (run-system))

This loop restarts the application each time it terminates.
