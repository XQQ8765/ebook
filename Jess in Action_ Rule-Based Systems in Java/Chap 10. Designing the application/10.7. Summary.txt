10.7. Summary

In this chapter, you began to turn the knowledge you developed in chapter 9 into a concrete rule-based system. You determined the form the data in working memory will take, you partitioned the system into modules that represent the phases of processing, and you developed some input/output functionality you will use later.

In the next chapter, you will develop the rules that form the actual application. We¡¯ll pay special attention to testing techniques, so that you¡¯ll trust the components of the application to work well individually and as a complete system.
