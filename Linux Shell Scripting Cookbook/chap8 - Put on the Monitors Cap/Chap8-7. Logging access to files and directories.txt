Logging access to files and directories


Logging of file and directory access is very helpful to keep track of changes that are happening to files and folders. This recipe will describe how to log user accesses. 

Getting ready
The inotifywait command? can be used to gather information about file accesses. It doesn't come by default with every Linux distro. You have to install the inotify-tools package? by using a package manager. It also requires the Linux kernel to be compiled with inotify support. Most of the new GNU/Linux distributions come with inotify enabled in the kernel.

How to do it...
Let's walk through the shell script to monitor the directory access:

#/bin/bash
#Filename: watchdir.sh
#Description: Watch directory access
path=$1
#Provide path of directory or file as argument to script
inotifywait -m -r -e create,move,delete $path -q


A sample output is as follows:

$ ./watchdir.sh .
./ CREATE new
./ MOVED_FROM new
./ MOVED_TO news
./ DELETE news


How it works...
The previous script will log events create, move, and delete files and folders from the given path. The -m option is given for monitoring the changes continuously rather than going to exit after an event happens. -r is given for enabling a recursive watch the directories. -e specifies the list of events to be watched. -q is to reduce the verbose messages and print only required ones. This output can be redirected to a log file. 

We can add or remove the event list. Important events available are as follows:

Event  Description  
access?  When some read happens to a file.  
modify?  When file contents are modified.  
attrib?  When metadata is changed.  
move?  When a file undergoes move operation.  
create?  When a new file is created.  
open?  When a file undergoes open operation.  
close?  When a file undergoes close operation.  
delete?  When a file is removed.
