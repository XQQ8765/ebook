Temporary file naming and random numbers


While writing shell scripts, we use often require to store temporary data. The most suitable location to store temporary data is /tmp (which will be cleaned out by the system on reboot). We can use two methods to generate standard filenames for temporary data. 

How to do it...
tempfile is not seen in non-Debian Linux distributions. The tempfile command comes shipped with Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu, Debian, and many more. 

The following code will assign a temporary filename to the variable temp_file: 

temp_file=$(tempfile)


Use echo $temp_file to print the temporary file name in the terminal.

The output will look similar to /tmp/fileaZWm8Y.

Sometimes we may use a filename with a random number attached to it as a temporary filename. This can be done as follows:

temp_file="/tmp/file-$RANDOM"


The $RANDOM environment variable always returns a random number. 

How it works…
Instead of using the tempfile command, we can also use our own temporary. Most experienced UNIX programmers use the following conventions: 

temp_file="/tmp/var.$$"


The .$$ suffix is attached. $$ is expanded as the process ID of the current script upon execution.
