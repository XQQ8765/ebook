Grabbing information about terminal


While writing command-line shell scripts, we will often need to heavily manipulate information about the current terminal, such as number of columns, rows, cursor positions, masked password fields, and so on. This recipe helps to learn about collecting and manipulating terminal settings. 

Getting ready
tput and stty are utilities that can be used for terminal manipulations. Let\'s see how to use them to perform different tasks.

How to do it...
Get number of columns and rows in a terminal as follows:

tput cols
tput lines


In order to print the current terminal name, use:

tput longname


For moving the cursor to a position 100,100 you can enter:

tput cup 100 100


Set the background color for terminal as follows:

tput setb no


no can be a value in the range of 0 to 7.

Set the foreground color for text as follows:

tput setf no


no can be a value in the range of 0 to 7.

In order to make the text bold use:

tput bold


Start and end underlining by using: 

tput smul
tput rmul


In order to delete from cursor to end of the line use:

tput ed


While typing a password, we should not display the characters typed. In the following example, we will see how to do it using stty: 

#!/bin/sh
#Filename: password.sh
echo -e "Enter password: "
stty -echo
read password
stty echo
echo
echo Password read.


The -echo option above disables output to the terminal, whereas echo enables output.
