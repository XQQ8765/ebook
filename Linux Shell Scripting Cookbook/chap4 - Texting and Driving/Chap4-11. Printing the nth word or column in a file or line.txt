Printing the nth word or column in a file or line


We may get a file having a number of columns and only a few will actually be useful. In order to print only relevant columns or fields, we filter it. 

Getting ready
The most widely-used method is to use awk for doing this task. It can be also done using cut.

How to do it...
To print the fifth column use the following command:

$ awk '{ print $5 }' filename


We can also print multiple columns and we can insert our custom string in between columns.

For example, to print the permission and filename of each file in the current directory, use:

$ ls -l | awk '{ print $1" : " $8 }'
-rw-r--r-- : delimited_data.txt
-rw-r--r-- : obfuscated.txt
-rw-r--r-- : paste1.txt
-rw-r--r-- : paste2.txt
