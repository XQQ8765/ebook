Replacing strings from a text or file


String replacement is a frequently-used text-processing task. It can be done easily with regular expressions by matching the required text. 

Getting ready
When we hear the term 'replace', every system admin will recall sed. sed is the universal tool under UNIX-like systems to make replacements in text or in a file. Let's see how to do it. 

How to do it...
The sed primer recipe contains most of the usages of sed. You can replace a string or pattern as follows:

$ sed 's/PATTERN/replace_text/g' filename


Or:

$ stdin | sed 's/PATTERN/replace_text/g'


We can also use double quote (") instead of single quote ('). When double quote (") is used, we can specify variables inside the sed pattern and replacement strings. For example:

$ p=pattern
$ r=replaced
$ echo "line containing apattern" | sed "s/$p/$r/g"
line containing a replaced


We can also use it without g in sed.

$ sed 's/PATTEN/replace_text/' filename


Then it will replace the occurrence of PATTERN first time it appears only. /g stands for global. That means, it will replace every occurrence of PATTERN in the file.

There's more...
We have seen basic text replacement with sed. Let's see how to save the replaced text in the source file itself.

Making replacement saved in the file
When a filename is passed to sed, it's output will be available to stdout. Instead of sending the output stream into stdout, to make changes saved in the file, use the i option as follows: 

$ sed 's/PATTERN/replacement/' -i filename


For example, replace all three-digit numbers with another specified number in a file as follows:

$ cat sed_data.txt
11 abc 111 this 9 file contains 111 11 88 numbers 0000
$ cat sed_data.txt | sed 's/\b[0-9]\{3\}\b/NUMBER/g'
11 abc NUMBER this 9 file contains NUMBER 11 88 numbers 0000


The above one-liner replaces three-digit numbers only.\b[0-9]\{3\}\b is the regular expression used to match three-digit numbers. [0-9] is the range of digits, that is, from 0 to 9. {3} is used for matching the preceding character thrice. \ in \{3\} is used to give a special meaning for { and }. \b is the word boundary marker.
