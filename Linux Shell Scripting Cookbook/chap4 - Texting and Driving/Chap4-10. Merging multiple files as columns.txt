Merging multiple files as columns


There are different cases when we require to concatenate files in columns. We may need each file's content to appear in separate columns. Usually, the cat command concatenates in a line- or row-wise fashion. 

How to do it...
paste is the command that can be used for column-wise concatenation. The paste command can be used with the following syntax: 

$ paste file1 file2 file3 бн 

Let's try an example as follows:

$ cat paste1.txt
1
2
3
4
5
$ cat paste2.txt
slynux
gnu
bash
hack
$ paste paste1.txt paste2.txt
1slynux
2gnu
3bash
4hack
5


The default delimiter is Tab. We can also explicitly specify the delimiter using d. For example: 

$ paste paste1.txt paste2.txt -d ","
1,slynux
2,gnu
3,bash
4,hack
5,
