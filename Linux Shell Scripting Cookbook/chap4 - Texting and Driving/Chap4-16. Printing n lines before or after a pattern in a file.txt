Printing n lines before or after a pattern in a file


Printing a section of text by pattern matching is frequently used in text processing. Sometimes we may need the lines of text before a pattern or after a pattern appears in a text. For example, consider that there is a file containing the rating of film actors where each line corresponds to a film actor's details, and we need to find out the rating of an actor along with the details of actors who are nearest to them in rating. Let's see how to do it. 

Getting ready
grep is the best tool for searching and finding text in a file. Usually, grep prints a matching line or matching text for a given pattern. But the context line control options in grep enables it to print before, after, and before-after lines around the line of pattern match. 

How to do it...
This technique can be better explained with a film actor list. For example:

$ cat actress_rankings.txt | head -n 20
1 Keira Knightley
2 Natalie Portman
3 Monica Bellucci
4 Bonnie Hunt
5 Cameron Diaz
6 Annie Potts
7 Liv Tyler
8 Julie Andrews
9 Lindsay Lohan
10 Catherine Zeta-Jones
11 CateBlanchett
12 Sarah Michelle Gellar
13 Carrie Fisher
14 Shannon Elizabeth
15 Julia Roberts
16 Sally Field
17 T¨¦aLeoni
18 Kirsten Dunst
19 Rene Russo
20 JadaPinkett


In order to print three lines after the match "Cameron Diaz" along with the matching line, use the following command:

$ grep -A 3 "Cameron Diaz" actress_rankings.txt
5 Cameron Diaz
6 Annie Potts
7 Liv Tyler
8 Julie Andrews


In order to print the matched line and the preceding three lines, use the following command:

$ grep -B 3 "Cameron Diaz" actress_rankings.txt
2 Natalie Portman
3 Monica Bellucci
4 Bonnie Hunt
5 Cameron Diaz


Print the matched line and the two lines before and after the matched line as follows: 

$ grep -C 2 "Cameron Diaz" actress_rankings.txt
3 Monica Bellucci
4 Bonnie Hunt
5 Cameron Diaz
6 Annie Potts
7 Liv Tyler


Are you wondering where I got this ranking from?

I parsed a website having full of images and HTML content just using basic sed, awk, and grep commands. See the chapter: Tangled Web? Not at all.
