Printing text between line numbers or patterns


We may require to print certain section of text lines based on conditions such as a range of line numbers, range matched by start and end pattern and so on. Let's see how to do it. 

Getting ready
We can use utilities such as awk, grep, and sed to perform the printing of a section based on conditions. Still I found awk to be the simplest one to understand. Let's do it using awk.

How to do it...
In order to print lines of text in a range of line numbers, M to N, use the following syntax:

$ awk 'NR==M, NR==N' filename


Or, it can take stdin input as follows:

$ cat filename | awk 'NR==M, NR==N'


Replace M and N with numbers as follows:

$ seq 100 | awk 'NR==4,NR==6'
4
5
6


To print lines of text in a section with start_pattern and end_pattern, use the following syntax:

$ awk '/start_pattern/, /end _pattern/' filename


For example:

$ cat section.txt
line with pattern1
line with pattern2
line with pattern3
line end with pattern4
line with pattern5
$ awk '/pa.*3/, /end/' section.txt
line with pattern3
line end with pattern4


The patterns used in awk are regular expressions.
