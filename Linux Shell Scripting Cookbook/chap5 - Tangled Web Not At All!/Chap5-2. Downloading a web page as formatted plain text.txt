Downloading a web page as formatted plain text


Web pages are HTML pages containing a collection of HTML tags along with other elements, such as JavaScript, CSS, and so on. But the HTML tags define the base of a web page. We may need to parse the data in a web page while looking for specific content, and this is something Bash scripting can help us with. When we download a web page, we receive an HTML file. In order to view formatted data, it should be viewed in a web browser. However, in most of the circumstances, parsing a formatted text document will be easier than parsing HTML data. Therefore, if we can get a text file with formatted text similar to the web page seen on the web browser, it is more useful and it saves a lot of effort required to strip off HTML tags. Lynx is an interesting command-line web browser. We can actually get the web page as plain text formatted output from Lynx. Let's see how to do it. 

How to do it...
Let's download the webpage view, in ASCII character representation, in a text file using the dump flag with the lynx command: 

$ lynx -dump URL > webpage_as_text.txt


This command will also list all the hyper-links (<a href="link">) separately under a heading References as the footer of the text output. This would help us avoid parsing of links separately using regular expressions.

For example:

$ lynx -dump http://google.com > plain_text_page.txt


You can see the plain text version of text by using the cat command as follows:

$ cat plain_text_page.txt
