#1.1 Benefits of Threads
* Multithreaded programs can improve throughput by utilizing available multiple processor resources more effectively.
* Using multiple threads can help achieve better throuput on single processor systems. For example, allowing the applications to still make progress during the blocking I/O.
* Simplify of developing and modeling. A complicated, asynchronous workflow can be decomposed into a number of simpler, synchronous workflows each running in a separate thread. A request can be processed synchronously as if it were a single-threaded program.
* More responsive user interface. Replace the main event loop with an event dispatch thread(EDT), the event thread remains free to process UI events, making the UI more responsive.

#1.2 Risks of Threads
* Safety Hazards. Allowing multiple threads to access and modify the same variables introduces an element of nonsequentiality into an otherwise sequential programming model, which can be confusing and difficult to reason about.
* Liveness Hazards. 
Bugs that cause liveness failures can be elusive because they depend on the relative timing of events in different threads.
* Performance Hazards
Context switches between threads have significant costs.
Must Use synchronization mechanisms on the shared memory bus.

#1.3 Various forms of liveness failures
* deadlock
* starvation
* livelock

#2.1 Which are best friends when designing thread-safe classes?
When designing thread-safe classes, good object-oriented techniques- encapsulation, immutability, and clear specification of invariants are your best friends.

#2.2 The three ways to fix the same mutable state variable is accessd by multiple threads without appropriate synchronization.
* Don't share the state variable across threads
* Make the state variable immutable
* Use synchronization whenever accessing the state variable

#2.3 Points of thread safety
* Stateless objects are always thread-safe.

#2.4 What's the purpose of 'java.util.concurrent.atomic' package?
The java.util.concurrent.atomic package contains atomic variable classes for effecting atomic state transitions on numbers and object references.

#2.5 What's he diffefent between a single element of state in a stateless class with more than one?
When a single element of state is added to a stateless class, the resulting class will be thread-safe if the state is entirely managed by a thread-safe object. But, as we¡¯ll see in the next section, going from one state variable to more than one is not necessarily as simple as going from zero to one.

#2.6 The practise of managing one class's state?
Where practical, use existing thread-safe objects, like AtomicLong, to manage your class¡¯s state. It is simpler to reason about the possible states and state transitions for existing thread-safe objects than it is for arbitrary state variables, and this makes it easier to maintain and verify thread safety.

#2.7 The protocols consistently can ensure state consistency.
* Compound actions on shared state must be made atomic to avoid race conditions.
* Holding a lock for the entire duration of a compound action can make that compound action atomic. However, just wrapping the compount action with a synchronized lock is not sufficient.
* If synchronization/locks is used to coordinate access to a variable, the same synchronization/lock must be used wherever that variable is accessed.
* It's a common mistake to assume that synchronization needs to be used only when writing to shared variables.
* Not all data needs to be guarded by locks- only mutable data that will be accessed from multiple threads.
* When a class has invariants that involve more than one state variable, each variable participating in the invariant must be guarded by the same lock. This allows you to access or update them in a single atomic operation, perserving the invariant.

#2.8 If synchronization is the cure for race conditions, why not just declare every method synchronized?
* Merely synchronizing every method is not enough to render compound actions. While synchronized methods can make individual operations atomic, additional locking is required when multiple oprations are combined into a compund action.
* Synchronizing every method can lead to liveness or performance problems.

#3.1 Locking and Visibility
Intrinsic locking can be used to guarantee that one thread sees the effects of another in a predictable manner. To ensure that all threads see the most up-to-date values of shared mutable variables, the reading and writing threads must synchronize on a common lock.

#3.2 Two functionalities of locks
* Mutual exclusion
* Memeory visibilit

#3.3 Why out-of-thin-air safety doesn't apply to 64-bit numeric variables?
The Java Memory Model requires fetch and store operations to be atomic, but for nonvolatile long and double variables, the JVM is permitted to treat a 64-bit read or write as two separate 32-bit operations. If the reads and writes occur in different threads, it is therefore possible to read a nonvolatile long and get back the high 32 bits of one value and the low 32 bits of another.[3] Thus, even if you don¡¯t care about stale values, it is not safe to use shared mutable long and double variables in multithreaded programs unless they are declared volatile or guarded by a lock.
